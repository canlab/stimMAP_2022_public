### <span style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 24px;">Experimental Design</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 20px;">
Participants eligible after the calibration session were invited to complete four additional sessions. Each session included:
- Four 8-minute pain tests
- Social manipulation
- Questionnaire on the social manipulation experience
- 20-minute tDCS
- Questionnaire on the tDCS experience (3 minutes)
- Four additional 8-minute pain tests
- Final questionnaire  
Treatment order in sessions 2-5 was randomized, with a 6-7 day interval between sessions.

### <span style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 24px;">Heat Stimulations</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 20px;">
Noxious heat was delivered to two locations on the right forearm using the TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc Ltd) with a 16-mm thermode end-plate. Each session included four runs of 8-minute heat stimulations before and after the social manipulation and tDCS (8 runs total). 
**Trial Details**:
- "Get Ready" message: 1 second  
- Jitter: 4-6 seconds  
- Heat stimulation: 13 seconds (1.5 seconds ramp up/down, 10 seconds plateau)  
- Jitter: 5-7 seconds  
- Pain rating: 7 seconds  
- Jitter: 6-10 seconds  
Each run included 12 trials with randomly applied low and high heat temperatures.

### <span style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 24px;">Social Manipulation</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 20px;">
Participants were informed of two possible tDCS protocols described as being developed by DARPA.  
- **Analgesic Protocol**: Relieves pain, improves mood, and enhances concentration.  
- **Hyperalgesic Protocol**: Increases pain sensations and unpleasantness.

Participants viewed a video featuring a confederate describing their experience with the assigned tDCS protocol. Videos were randomized, with gender and identity balanced across sessions. Afterward, participants completed a questionnaire assessing their expectations for tDCS and heat stimulations.

### <span style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 24px;">tDCS Design</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 20px;">
The tDCS protocol used the StarStim system (Neuroelectrics, Spain) with the following parameters:
- Intensity: 2 mA for 20 minutes  
- Ramp-up/down: 30 seconds  
- Electrode Placement: C3 (anode) and FP2 (cathode) based on the 10-10 EEG system.  

During tDCS, participants viewed random fractal images for potential future memory tasks. After stimulation, participants completed a questionnaire regarding sensations experienced during tDCS.
